# Coderage Version 2.0

## Ruff start

This is a work in progress. It is not yet ready for use.

- Switching Code Rage to SSR to make it more secure, faster and SEO friendly.
- I'll keep it mind that SSR is not all shinny and perfect, so I'll probably add some CSR eventually.
- Adding a new UI with Tailwind following the Material guidelines (almost the same as the old one)
- Get rid of Strapi and lots of packages (There's a bunch already but it's for mainly for testing)
- Using Prisma to manage the Postgres DB
- Don't make the same errors as with the first version

Why are you coding the website again you just started to write articles?

- Well, I'm a perfectionist and I want to make everything better.
- I'm also learning a lot of new things and I want to apply them to this project.
- I usually mix things that people don't usually mix, so I can't just copy paste everything from Google. I love to suffer.
- So, I'll take time to write articles about the process and the new things I'm learning.
- Lastly, I love to code and learn continuously.
